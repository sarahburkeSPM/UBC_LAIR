test result:

1. Need to manually input the voltage vector in 'load3dsall.m' under 'WRITES THE VOLTAGE TO A VECTOR'

2. Need to manually modify 'load3dsall.m' under 'TAKES THE MIDPOINT OF THE VOLTAGE DATA '

3. Brandon used numerical didv only, need to implement lockin signal in the code 

4. Modified the code to fit lockindIdV, including producing LockinQPI

5. x_num=xsize


In Test file the 2 codes are now compatible with 007


Now test another Grid map 

Tested on other Grid, they now works, however, Processed data looks missing some of the data 

Seokhwan's code can not plot cropped data? IT CAN 

dIdV data can be in different channel, change line 141 in file load3dsall.m accordingly

In Symmetrizing2.m, line 107, why circshift 3rd dimension by 100 elements. 


PtSn4 specific things: 

applied qx, qy fold symmetry.

How to define the qx and qy direction in QPI map from the brag peaks. 

Note that in real space, Pt-Pt bond is 45deg off to the a&c directions, so the bragg peak should also be 45deg off qa and qc, therefore, the axis of our map is qa and qc but dont know which is which. 

the self-correlation function maintains the function's symmetry.

While taking the grid: 
real space Resolution does not have to be too fine since the important info lies within the bragg peaks, which is q_bragg=~2pi/0.5-> q_range: q_bragg/sqrt(2)~10.5(nm^-1)-> R_resolution=~2pi/q_range=0.7nm/pixel->dim:pix~=1:3 to 1:4.
