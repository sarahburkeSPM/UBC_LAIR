UBC_LAIR functions

all functions used in the UBC_LAIR scripts must be stored in this folder! 

This ensures, by downlaoding the UBC_LAIR git and adding it to the MATLAB path all scripts can be run. 

Functions are sorted in sub folders as follows:

code written by the LAIR group is sorted by it's primary task
loading:        all functions inporting data 
processing:     all functions processing data, or executing tasks like masking e.g.
visualization:  all functions plotting data, rendering videos, ...

external code
toolboxes:      are saved in individual folders (e.g. flatToolbox) in the functions folder (Do not copy standard MATLAB toolboxes like ImageProcessing, ...) 
functions:      are saved in the 3rdPary folder. Create a new sub folder for every function and include all information (e.g. license files!)

colormaps:      any colormaps used for visualization can be stored here
