% analyzed. The log file is initialized based on the given values. 

% Potentially to be merged with (2) if grid load upwards is updated
% accordingly, to use uigetfile/uigetdir intrinsically. 

% use the pathApp (to be found on the LAIR Git) to add directories of your 
% data and scripts to the MATLAB path.
